=head1 NAME

Fun - simple function signatures

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Fun;

  fun float_eq ($a, $b, $e = 0.0001) {
      return abs($a - $b) < $e;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This mdoule provides C<fun>, a new keyword which defines functions the same way
that C<sub> does, except allowing for function signatures. These signatures
support defaults and slurpy arguments, but no other advanced features. The
behavior should be equivalent to taking the signature, stripping out the
defaults, and injecting C<< my <sig> = @_ >> at the start of the function, and
then applying defaults as appropriate.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 fun

Behaves identically to C<sub>, except that it does not support prototypes or
attributes, but it does support a simple function signature. This signature
consists of a comma separated list of variables, each variable optionally
followed by C<=> and an expression to use for a default. For instance:

  fun foo ($x, $y = 5) {
      ...
  }

Defaults are evaluated every time the function is called, so global variable
access and things of that sort should work correctly.

C<fun> supports creating both named and anonymous functions, just as C<sub>
does.

=head1 BUGS
